Hi, I’m **Ashish Gaddala** from Hyderabad. I have around **3 years of experience as a System Engineer at Infosys**, where I worked on building **scalable and responsive full-stack web applications** using the **MERN stack** and **Next.js**.

One of my key projects was a **Hospitality Management Platform**, a full-stack hotel booking app where I implemented **secure authentication with JWT**, **filtering, pagination**, and a **responsive dashboard** using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. I also focused on **backend optimization** with Express.js and MongoDB.

Apart from that, I built **DevEats**, an online food ordering app using **React and Redux Toolkit**, which helped me strengthen my frontend architecture and state management skills.

I’m passionate about building clean, maintainable applications and continuously learning new technologies. Currently, I’m looking for a **full-stack developer role** where I can contribute to impactful projects and grow with the team.
